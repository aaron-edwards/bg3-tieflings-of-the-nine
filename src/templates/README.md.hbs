## Changelog
### Version 1.0
- Initail release
- Adds Baalzebul, Dispater, Fierna, Glasya, Mammon & Levistus Tieflings
### Version 1.1
- Fixes issue where casting the spell provided at level 3 would use a spell slot
- Fixes issues were spells provided at level 3 would be the leve1 1 version of the spell rather than the level 2 version

## Known issues
- The Disguise self spell provided by Dispater & Glasya Tieflings at level 3 can be cased at will rather than once a long rest
    - I could not figure out a way to limit it but I don't think this is too unbalance/gamebreaking (especially knowing there is an invocation that allows you to cast this spell at will)
    - I will be unlikly to address this issue
- The Charm person spell provided by Fierna Tieflings at level 3 will only target a single target.
    - This seems to be a bug with the level 2 casting of this spell

## Future plans
- ~~Fix some issues with Larian's Tieflings~~
    - ~~Fix Larian's Asmodeus tiefling (it currenty does not add the 3rd level spell)~~
    - ~~Fix Larian's Zariel tiefling (it currently adds Jump rather than wraithful smite)~~
    - These have been addressed in another mod [Tiefling Racials](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/39) by [Vaylentine](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/98459743)
- Possibly add some of the variant subraces found in Sword Coast Adventure Guide
